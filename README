RESIZED
=======

DESCRIPTION
  A daemon to move and resize windows into predefined locations.

USAGE
  Opens a named pipe /tmp/resized which accepts the following commands:

    <screenid>.<positionid> -- mark point on screen
    "+"                     -- maximize the active window
    "a<STRING>"             -- activate window with a title matching <STRING>
    "QUIT"                  -- quit

  Assign keyboard shortcuts using your favorite software to write these
  commands to /tmp/resized. A suggestion is to map "<Super>KP_End" to run
  "sh -c 'echo 0.1 >/tmp/resized'", for example.

  The "mark point" commands are used to move and resize the active window.
  If a single command is sent, the window will be moved to that position.
  If two commands are received within a short time, these points specify
  the corners of the window. The first command specifies the upper left
  corner and bottom right corner of the window. 
  
  When marking points, <screenid> is which screen, starting from 0, and
  <positionid> which is a number between 1 and 9 which is mapped to
  positions on the screen in a way that resembles the layout of the
  numeric keypad. For example, "0.7" marks the upper left corner on the
  first screen.

  EXAMPLE:
      # echo "0.8" >/tmp/resized;
    moves the active window to the top half of the first screen

  EXAMPLE:
      # echo "0.7" >/tmp/resized; echo "0.7" >/tmp/resized
    moves the active window to the upper left corner of the first screen.

  EXAMPLE:
      # echo "0.7" >/tmp/resized; echo "0.3" >/tmp/resized
    moves the active window to fill the whole first screen.

  EXAMPLE:
      # echo "a*Firefox" >/tmp/resized
    activates the window whose title ends with Firefox.
